# Remote desktop on iPad and VScode on Win10

I was very happy with the keyboard I got, because it has a trackpad. 
With the new iPad OS update, I can have access to most of the web apps, such as overleaf and github.

The most thing I want is to use it with my remote desktop app and I can bring the computing power with me within the iPad.
However, when I test out the remotes, none of them can be used correctly.

## Teamviewer

Teamviewer was the best among the all, but has a crucial bug.
It supports a lot keyboard short cuts, even including the ones requires win key.
But when I try to click the "run all" button, it jut did not work.
I cannot click that text as a button no matter what.

## Chrome

I can sort of accept that all special keys not work in Chrome remote,
but why that arrow keys are considered as special keys?
That means no text editing is possible

## Citrix Virtual Sinc Site

Special keys except win button are all working. But all the punctuations are replaced by some "SMART" punctuations.
Such as the none sense directed quotes, and double dash is a long dash.
This is basically not acceptable in coding.

## Citrix Virtual Sinc Site and Chrome Remote

I even tried to use Chrome Remote inside the Sinc Site,
It does not work as expected.
You see, not punctuations are working in Chrome Remote in Citrix.

## Conclusion

Finally I have to accept that I still cannot do any serious coding work on my iPad.
It is a shame that the disability is due to the lack of apps.
